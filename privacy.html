					</p>
					<p class="text-gray-400">Last updated March&nbsp;3,&nbsp;2024</p>
				</div>


				<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
				<p>This Privacy Policy sets out how we, Eighred Limited <b>(“Eighred”)</b>, use and protect your
					personal data that you provide to us, or that is otherwise obtained or generated by us, in
					connection with your use of our services <b>(“the Services”)</b>. For the purposes of this Privacy
					Policy, <b>‘we’</b>, <b>‘us’</b> and <b>‘our’</b> refers to Eighred, and <b>‘you’</b> refers to you,
					the user of the&nbsp;Services.</p>

				<h3>1.1. Privacy Principles</h3>
				<p>Eighred has two fundamental principles when it comes to collecting and processing private data:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>We don't use your data to show you ads.</li>
					<li>We only store the data that Eighred needs to function as a secure and feature-rich service.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>1.2. Terms of Service</h3>
				<p>This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Service, which describes the terms under which you use
					our Services and which are available at <a href="terms"
						target="_blank">https://eighred.com/terms</a>. This Privacy Policy should therefore be read in
					conjunction with those terms.</p>


				<h3>2. Legal Ground for Processing Your Personal Data</h3>
				<p>We process your personal data on the ground that such processing is necessary to further our
					legitimate interests (including: (1) providing effective and innovative Services to our users;
					and (2) to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud or security issues in respect of our
					provision of Services), unless those interests are overridden by your interest or fundamental
					rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data.</p>



				<h3>3. Eighred ID</h3>
				<p>Your Eighred credentials are used to activate Eighred services upon login, including Eighred Cloud
					Backup, which automatically backs up data on your device in case you need to replace or restore to
					your device.</p>



				<h3>4. Keeping Your Personal Data Safe</h3>

				<p>Eighred Cloud protects your information as it moves from place to place by encrypting and storing it
					in encrypted form in Eighred Cloud and using secure tokens for authentication. Eighred uses
					end-to-end encryption for certain information. This means that information is intentionally
					accessible only to you and the devices through which you log into the Eighred Cloud. No one, not
					even Eighred, can access end-to-end encrypted information. For more information about Eighred Cloud
					Data Security, go to <a href="cloud" target="_blank"> https://eighred.com/cloud</a>.</p>

				<p>Both Eighred's and third parties' centers may be used to store and process your data. When processing
					data stored in a third party data center, the encryption keys will only be accessible by Eighred
					software running on secure servers and only when the necessary processing is being performed.</p>


				<h3>5. We let you know why we collect and use your personal information and get your consent</h3>

				<p>Eighred identifies the purpose for which your personal information is collected and will be used or
					disclosed. If that purpose is not listed below we will do this before or at the time the information
					is actually being collected. You will be deemed to consent to our use of your personal information
					for the purpose of:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>communicating with you generally</li>
					<li>processing your purchases</li>
					<li>processing and keeping track of transactions and reporting back to you</li>
					<li>protecting against fraud or error</li>
					<li>providing product and services requested by you</li>
					<li>recommending products and services that Eighred believes will be of interest and provide value
						to you </li>
					<li>performing statistical analyses of user behaviour and characteristics, in order to measure
						interest in and use of the various sections of this site so as to improve design and navigation
						and to gather marketing information. Only aggregated data from these analyses, not individual
						data, will be used for this purpose </li>
					<li>complying with legal and governmental requirements</li>
					<li>fulfilling any other purpose that would be reasonably apparent to the average person at the time
						we collect it from you </li>
				</ul>

				<p>Otherwise, Eighred will obtain your express consent (by verbal, written or electronic agreement) to
					collect, use or disclose your personal information. You can change your consent preferences at any
					time by contacting Eighred (please refer to the “How to contact us” section below). </p>



				<h3>6. We limit collection of your personal information</h3>

				<p>Eighred collects only the information required to provide products and services to you. Eighred
					will collect personal information only by clear, fair and lawful means.</p>

				<p>We receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way. You can
					choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many
					of our features.</p>

				<p>We also receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example,
					like many websites, we use “cookies,” and we obtain certain types of information when your web
					browser accesses eighred.com.</p>

				<p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web
					browser, to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features such as keeping you
					logged in to your Eighred account.</p>

				<p>The “help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from
					accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to
					disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser
					add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on’s settings or visiting the website of its
					manufacturer. </p>

				<p>Examples of the information we collect and analyze include the Internet protocol (IP) address used to
					connect your computer to the Internet; login; e-mail address; password; computer and connection
					information, such as browser type, version and timezone setting, browser plug-in types and versions,
					operating system, and platform; the full Uniform Resource Locators (URL) clickstream to, through,
					and from our website, including date and time; cookie numbers; products you viewed or searched for;
					and the telephone number used to call our customer service number. We may also use browser data such
					as cookies, Flash cookies (also known as Flash Local Shared Objects), or similar data on certain
					parts of our website for fraud prevention and other purposes. During some visits we may use software
					tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times,
					download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling,
					clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page.</p>




				<h3>7. We limit disclosure and retention of your personal information</h3>

				<p>Eighred does not disclose personal information to any organization or person for any reason except
					the following:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include
						fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive
						information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing
						credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information
						needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. We may use service
						providers located outside of Canada, and, if applicable, your personal information may be
						processed and stored in other countries and therefore may be subject to disclosure under the
						laws of those countries. </li>
					<li>As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business
						units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business
						assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of
						course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Eighred or
						substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information of course will be one of the
						transferred assets. </li>
				</ul>

				<p>You are deemed to consent to disclosure of your personal information for those purposes. If your
					personal information is shared with third parties, those third parties are bound by appropriate
					agreements with Eighred to secure and protect the confidentiality of your personal information.</p>

				<p>Eighred retains your personal information only as long as it is required for our business
					relationship or as required by federal and provincial laws.</p>



				<h3>8. We keep your personal information up to date and accurate</h3>

				<p>Eighred keeps your personal information up to date, accurate and relevant for its intended use.</p>

				<p>You may request access to the personal information we have on record in order to review and amend the
					information, as appropriate. In circumstances where your personal information has been provided by a
					third party, we will refer you to that party (e.g. credit bureaus). To access your personal
					information, refer to the “How to contact us” section below.</p>

				<h3>The security of your personal information is a priority for Eighred</h3>

				<p>We take steps to safeguard your personal information, regardless of the format in which it is held,
					including:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>physical security measures such as restricted access facilities and locked filing cabinets</li>
					<li>electronic security measures for computerized personal information such as password protection,
						database encryption and personal identification numbers. We work to protect the security of your
						information during transmission by using “Transport Layer Security” (TLS) protocol.</li>
					<li>organizational processes such as limiting access to your personal information to a selected
						group of individuals
					</li>
					<li>contractual obligations with third parties who need access to your personal information
						requiring them to protect and secure your personal information</li>
				</ul>

				<p>It’s important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and your computer. Be
					sure to sign off when you’ve finished using any shared computer.</p>



				<h3>9. What About Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites?</h3>

				<p>Our site may include third-party advertising and links to other websites. We do not provide any
					personally identifiable customer information to these advertisers or third-party websites.</p>

				<p>These third-party websites and advertisers, or Internet advertising companies working on their
					behalf, sometimes use technology to send (or “serve”) the advertisements that appear on our website
					directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may
					also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and
					other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content.
					We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that they may use, and the
					information practices of these advertisers and third-party websites are not covered by this Privacy
					Notice. Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices. In
					addition, the Network Advertising Initiative offers useful information about Internet advertising
					companies (also called “ad networks” or “network advertisers”), including information about how to
					opt-out of their information collection.</p>



				<h3>10. We are open about our privacy and security policy</h3>

				<p>We are committed to providing you with understandable and easily available information about our
					policy and practices related to management of your personal information. This policy and any related
					information is available at all times on our website, www.eighred.com under Privacy or on request.
					To contact us, refer to the “How to contact us” section below.</p>

				<h3>We provide access to your personal information stored by Eighred</h3>

				<p>You can request access to your personal information stored by Eighred. To contact us, refer to the
					“How to contact us” section below. Upon receiving such a request, Eighred will:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>inform you about what type of personal information we have on record or in our control, how it
						is used and to whom it may have been disclosed </li>
					<li>provide you with access to your information so you can review and verify the accuracy and
						completeness and request changes to the information </li>
					<li>make any necessary updates to your personal information</li>
				</ul>




				<h3>11. We respond to your questions, concerns and complaints about privacy</h3>

				<p>Eighred responds in a timely manner to your questions, concerns and complaints about the privacy of
					your personal information and our privacy policies and procedures.</p>



				<h3>12. How to contact us</h3>

				<ul>
					<li>by email at <a href="mailto:support@eighred.com">[email&#160;protected]</a>.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Our business changes constantly, and this privacy notice will change also. We may e-mail periodic
					reminders of our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed us not to, but you should check
					our website frequently to see recent changes. We are, however, committed to protecting your
					information and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective
					of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.</p>
